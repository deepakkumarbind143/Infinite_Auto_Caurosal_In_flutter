<h2>ðŸ“Œ Setup Instructions</h2>
<h3>Create the Required Folder and Move the File</h3>
<h5>
After cloning the repository, you need to manually create an assets folder in your Flutter project and move the mock_cars.json file inside it.
</h5><br>
Steps:
Navigate to your Flutter project directory.

Create an assets folder if it doesn't exist:

>your_flutter_project/<br>
â”—â”€â”€ assets/<br>
    â”—â”€â”€ mock_cars.json  ðŸ‘ˆ Place the file here

Register the assets folder in pubspec.yaml:
```
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/mock_cars.json

```
##Run:

`flutter pub get`
Now, the app will be able to read the mock_cars.json file correctly.
